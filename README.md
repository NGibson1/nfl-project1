### Description
This was a final project for my second front end development class, Front-End Foundations at Eastern Gateway Comunity College. It's a Landing page, with a video that plays, and fades in and out of sight using CSS animations. Its Responsinve with the help of BootStraps grid system, and also uses BootStrap's card class to create a card for every NFL team, and is styled using team colors. Each card is a link to a page for the corresponding team. 

I'll need to go back and edit the CSS for smaller screens so it display a bit more user friendly. I plan on going back and adding a table displaying team records, and personal team records for each teams pages. I also plan on adding NFL all-time records on the landing page.
